[ x] 2. List of the Technologies used:
Code Style:
I created each page as a directory within my terminal. Each page contains a css stylesheet, an index.html page and a JS page.  i didnt personally use JS at all.  The pages were all coded in my editior of choice, "VSCode". I tried to focus on one page at a time, none the less, i designed the portfolio as a collect.  The portfolio contains insperation from W3Schools, tiktockers, and youtube.

[ x] 3. Installation instructions: See above to numer 2.
its really simple over all. I let the coding take over and we went on an adventure.

[x ] 4. Your User stories – who are your users, what do they want and why?

[x ] 6. Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
I had a lot of problems with the CSS in general; my buttons, picture and formats were just not what I pictured. It is stll a work in progress.I now realize that a lot of this could have been balanced out by incorporating JavaScript and the DOM/DOM Events.

Katherine Sinkler's Professional Portfolio
This is a project that will allow me to code a 3-page portfolio as a class project and as a necessary tool to start my career as a techie.

Build Status: 
This project called for three pages:
1. An 'About Me Page that allows me to introduce myself and my style. 
This page is fairly simple and basic. This page contains 2 buttons that directly link to the other 2 pages.
---Be aware: The bio button is just really weird, but it works. The structure of the page is alive and moves freely. I could not figure out how to make this page mobile friendly at ths time.
2.The 'Bio Page' provides a little more information about me in a quick questionaire style read.  
3.The Resume Page:
This page is self explanatory; It is a resume that contains information about who I am, where I have been, and where I plan on going professionally. 

Code Style:
I created each page as a directory within my terminal. Each page contains a css stylesheet, an index.html page and a JS page.  i didnt personally use JS at all.  The pages were all coded in my editior of choice, "VSCode". I tried to focus on one page at a time, none the less, i designed the portfolio as a collect.  The portfolio contains insperation from W3Schools, tiktockers.
