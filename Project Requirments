Have the following sections:
Home (greeting page)
Bio/About Me (your background)
Resume (past work experience)
Projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build -- we'll be adding to this as we build more applications in class)
Links (links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites you find interesting)
TIP: Possible implementation of this section could be a
element.
Use JS to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens). Write these from scratch. Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals).
Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
